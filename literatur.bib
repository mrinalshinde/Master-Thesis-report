Formulas are presented for the axial loss of gain and the pattern degradation as a function of the reflector surface rms error and the surface spatial correlation. Methods of determining these quantities by astronomical or ground-based electrical measurements are described. Correlation between the theoretical predictions and the performance of actual large antenna structures is presented.},

It is assumed that the antenna to be measured is a passive, linear, and reciprocal device. The measurement of radiation patterns on an antenna range, the design of antenna ranges or antenna test facilities, the instrumentation required for the antenna range, directions for the evaluation of an (existing) range, and the operation of ranges are discussed. A variety of special measurement techniques are also included.<>},

  abstract  = {5G mobile devices and base stations will be operating antenna arrays and beam-steering techniques in the millimeter-wave region. The question of the far-field measurement distance is particularly critical for such technologies as a larger over-the-air test range means dynamic range issues and significantly larger cost. The traditionally used formula for the far-field distance aims at limiting the impinging field phase curvature. Using this criterion leads to testing distances of more than 6 meters to assess the far-field radiation pattern of a 5G smartphone equipped with 39 GHz transceiver. This paper investigates the physical relevance of such a large distance. It uses spherical wave expansion theory to establish two new far-field distance definitions, including considerations on the antenna directivity. An initial set of measurement data is provided to support the findings that much shorter distances than commonly known can be used for accurate far-field evaluation in the main radiation beam.},
