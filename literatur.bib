  abstract  = {5G mobile devices and base stations will be operating antenna arrays and beam-steering techniques in the millimeter-wave region. The question of the far-field measurement distance is particularly critical for such technologies as a larger over-the-air test range means dynamic range issues and significantly larger cost. The traditionally used formula for the far-field distance aims at limiting the impinging field phase curvature. Using this criterion leads to testing distances of more than 6 meters to assess the far-field radiation pattern of a 5G smartphone equipped with 39 GHz transceiver. This paper investigates the physical relevance of such a large distance. It uses spherical wave expansion theory to establish two new far-field distance definitions, including considerations on the antenna directivity. An initial set of measurement data is provided to support the findings that much shorter distances than commonly known can be used for accurate far-field evaluation in the main radiation beam.},

  abstract  = {A planar dual-polarized patch antenna array with vertical beamforming capability is presented. The array is designed in terms of three horizontal rows consisting of ten elements each. They are fed in series transmission line architecture and the design frequency was chosen to 24.125GHz, which is the center of the 24GHz ISM-band. Each patch branch was matched against a 10-dB reflection-loss criterion. In the horizontal plane the array's directivity pattern is determined by the horizontal pattern of the respective rows. It exhibits a sidelobe level of less than -17 dB. This was achieved by appropriately tapering the amplitude distribution across all elements of a row. Radiated cross-polarization and isolation of the feed ports show accordingly good values. Inter-element space could be reduced to approximately 0.6 Λ0 in each row. The respective spacing between the rows is roughly on wavelength. The novelties and the potential of this dual-polarized antenna array are discussed in detail and its characteristics are brought forward by simulation and measurement results.},
