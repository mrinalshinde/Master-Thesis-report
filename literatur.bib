  abstract = {This standard comprises test procedures for the measurement of antenna properties. It is a comprehensive revision of the previous test procedure ANSI/IEEE Std 149-1965. It is assumed that the antenna to be measured is a passive, linear, and reciprocal device. The measurement of radiation patterns on an antenna range, the design of antenna ranges or antenna test facilities, the instrumentation required for the antenna range, directions for the evaluation of an (existing) range, and the operation of ranges are discussed. A variety of special measurement techniques are also included.<>},
