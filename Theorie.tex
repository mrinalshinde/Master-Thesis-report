\chapter{Theoretical Background}

This chapter will give a brief overview about the underlying theoretical background in the fields of antenna theory, spatial sampling and will introduce some methods of integration to derive the \ac{TRP} out of spherical \ac{EIRP}-data.

\section{Antenna Field Regions}

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig:antennafieldreg}
\end{figure}

There are three commonly known antenna regions, the reactive \ac{NF}, the radiating \ac{NF} and the \ac{FF}, divided by tow boundaries, the Fresnel distance (blue) and the Fraunhofer distance (yellow). These distances are shown in figure \ref{fig:antennafieldreg}, where the aperture diameter of an arbitrary antenna is on the x-axis and the distance form it is on the y-axis. The third line, the Derat distance (red) was introduced by Benoit Derat. \cite{8393926} All distances will be explained in the following.\\
\ac{FF}-distance and \ac{NF}-distance are derivable from the phase fluctuation due to the maximum diameter of the antennas aperture \cite{7942128} in a distance $R$ from the antennas phase center. The phase fluctuation is given by the different length of $r$ and $R$, as you can see in figure \ref{fig:arbaperturexy}. The maximum runtime difference is found at the minimum radius of the circle enclosing the aperture at $\sfrac{D}{2}$. The field boundaries are derived from the Taylor series of the function of the phase in dot $P$. \cite{7942128}

\subsection{Near-Field}

The reactive \acf{NF} is according to \cite{balanis} \glqq that portion of the near-field region immediately surrounding the antenna wherein the reactive field predominates.\grqq{ }In other words, the reactive \ac{NF} is that portion of an antennas field were you would expect direct coupling. The boundary of that field region is derived for big apertures by a line source and the underlying phase fluctuation of  $\Delta\phi = \sfrac{\pi}{8} \ \widehat{=}\  22.5^\circ$. The boundary is \cite{8393926}:
\begin{equation}
r_{\text{NF}} = 0.62\sqrt{\frac{D^3}{\lambda}}
\end{equation}
After that the radiating \ac{NF} (Fresnel) -region follows, which is defined as \glqq that region of the field of an antenna between the reactive near-field region and the far-field region wherein radiation fields predominate and wherein the angular field distribution is dependent upon the distance from the antenna.\grqq

\subsection{Far-Field}

The fraunhofer distance is derived from optical considerations. The commonly used terminology is \acf{FF}-distance. According to \cite{balanis} the \ac{FF}-distance is \glqq that region of the field of an antenna where the angular field distribution is essentially independent of the distance from the antenna.\grqq \\
The amount of independency is derived from the phase fluctuation in the distance $r_{\text{FF}}$ \cite{19510}:

\begin{equation}
\Delta\phi = \frac{\pi D^2}{4\lambda\cdot r_{\text{FF}}} ,\ D\gg\lambda 
\end{equation}

The commonly used maximum phase fluctuation is $\Delta\phi = \sfrac{\pi}{8} \ \widehat{=}\  22.5^\circ$. With that the well known formula
\begin{equation}
r_{\text{FF}} = \frac{2D^2}{\lambda}
\end{equation}

can be derived.

\subsection{Derat Distance}

The Derat distance is that distance, in which the main beam of an antenna is in \ac{FF} condition. For the understanding of the Derat distance $r_{\text{Dr}}$ other considerations need to take place: It is about spherical modes described by spherical Hankel functions  of the second kind. \cite{8393926} \cite{hansen}\\
In \cite{8393926} it is shown, that higher order modes than 

\begin{equation}
N = \lceil 1.0252\cdot\left(\frac{\pi D}{\lambda}\right)^{0.8633} \rceil
\end{equation}

have a maximum influence to the \ac{EIRP} of $\SI{0.5}{\decibel}$. With that the Derat distance can be derived to:

\begin{equation}
r_{\text{Dr}} = \lambda\left(\frac{\pi D}{\lambda}\right)^{0.8633}\left(0.1673\left(\frac{\pi D}{\lambda}\right)^{0.8633}+0.1632\right)
\end{equation}

\label{fig:beamcpmp}
\end{figure}

To clarify the introduced distances they will be proofed based on a $\SI{20}{\decibel}$ \ac{SGH} at $\SI{28}{\giga\hertz}$. If you look in the annex at figure \ref{fig:fielddist} you see the front view of this horn with the underlying field distribution. The polarisation is in $y$-direction, so the $yz$-plane is called E-plane and the $xz$-plane is called H-plane from here on.\\
In figure \ref{fig:beamcpmp} the normalized wave impedance (a) and the normalized phase between E- and H-field components over the distance to the phase center are plotted. To clarify the designations the directions are plotted in (c). The data has been produces by CST\texttrademark , a full wave simulation tool. Complex data in $x$, $y$, and $z$ direction was exported to Matlab\texttrademark and there post processed.\\
Also the field boundaries from the sections above are plotted with dashed lines. For deriving the boundaries only the opening of the horn in the E-plane was taken to account. This is rational because the field distribution and thus the usage of the aperture is known, refer to figure \ref{fig:fielddist}. As you can see in the E-plane the aperture is fully used. But if the field distribution is unknown the smallest circle enclosing the aperture has to be taken.\\
In \ref{fig:beamcpmp} (a) the normalized wave impedance of the different angels (refer to (c)) is plotted over the distance from the antennas phase center. \ref{fig:beamcpmp} (b) shows analogue to (a) the phase between E- and H-field.\\
The main lobe (blue line) is from Derat-distance on in \ac{FF} condition. On the one hand side the wave impedance reached its endvalue of $\SI{377}{\ohm}$ and on the other hand E- and H-fields are coherent. Considering the side lobes it can be seen that in the reactive \ac{NF} the field conditions are very unstable, whereas the fields in the radiating \ac{NF} become more stable. In the \ac{FF} the field values are continually decreasing the offset from their final value.\\
In figure \ref{fig:devantennap} in the annex the resulting antenna patterns in different radii are depicted as well in Cartesian coordinates (a) as in Polar coordinates (b). The assumption 

\begin{equation}
S = \frac{E^2}{Z_0}
\end{equation}

was taken to account. At Derat distance ($\approx\SI{100}{\milli\meter}$) the error in main beam direction is about $\SI{0.5}{\decibel}$ and the antenna pattern is further evolving after the Fraunhofer distance at about $\SI{200}{\milli\meter}$.
