\section{Terms}

To make sure that every reader knows the most important Terms in this Document, they will be declared regarding \cite{seitur} and \cite{ctiaat} here:

\begin{itemize}
\item An \textbf{\acf{UnE}} consists of \acl{SE} and \acl{OOB}.
\item A \textbf{\acf{SE}} is an emission on a frequency, or frequencies, which are outside the necessary bandwidth and the level of which may be reduced without affecting the corresponding transmission of information. \acl{SE} include harmonic
emissions, parasitic emissions, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products but exclude \aclp{OOB}.
\item A\textbf{\acf{OOB}} is an emission on a frequency or frequencies immediately outside the necessary bandwidth which results from the modulation process, but excluding \aclp{SE}.
\item \textbf{\acf{TRP}} is the average spherical \ac{EIRP}. Or in other words the power that an isotropic radiator, with the same input, would emit in every direction.
\item \textbf{\acf{RSE}}
\end{itemize}
