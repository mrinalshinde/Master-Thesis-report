\section{Motivation}

\ac{3GPP} \ac{5G} is occupying \acp{mmW}. With this development big and highly integrated  \acp{AAS} will be needed. That makes the classical conformance test approach with antenna connectors in the \ac{UE} impossible. The equivalent metric for \ac{RSE} is now \ac{TRP} and the measurement is carried out \ac{OTA}.

\section{Aim}

The aim of this work is to find a optimal solution for conformance  \ac{TRP}-measurements using \acp{AC}. In dependence of the dimension of the \ac{DUT} a ideal grid and a perfect measurement distance for a wanted precision must be found. To achieve that, theoretical knowledge must be projected on simulations and the outcome must be proofed in real measurements.

\section{Terms}

To make sure that every reader knows the most important terms in this document, they will be declared regarding \cite{seitur} and \cite{ctiaat} here:

\begin{itemize}
\item An \textbf{\acf{UnE}} consists of \acl{SE} and \acl{OOB}.
\item A \textbf{\acf{SE}} is an emission on a frequency, or frequencies, which are outside the necessary bandwidth and the level of which may be reduced without affecting the corresponding transmission of information. \acl{SE} include harmonic
emissions, parasitic emissions, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products but exclude \aclp{OOB}.
\item A \textbf{\acf{OOB}} is an emission on a frequency or frequencies immediately outside the necessary bandwidth which results from the modulation process, but excluding \aclp{SE}.
\item \textbf{\acf{TRP}} is the average spherical \ac{EIRP}. Or in other words the power that an isotropic radiator, with the same input, would emit in every direction.
\end{itemize}
