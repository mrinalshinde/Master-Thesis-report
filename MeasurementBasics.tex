This chapter gives an overview over the challenges and solutions of \ac{OTA}-measurements. There are four main architectures for \ac{OTA}-measurement: \cite{ach}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{\acf{RVC}}: The \ac{RVC} is fully screened inside, which makes it a resonator. Because the \ac{EM} field inside is very inhomogeneous (standing waves) there are several so called stirrers to generate random \ac{EM} modes. With a \ac{RVC} \ac{EM} emission in arbitrary direction can be measured using a fixed antenna.
\item \textbf{\acf{AC}}: An \ac{AC} is depicted in figure \ref{fig:ats}. It's a chamber which absorbs every \ac{EM} wave that would normally be reflected from the walls. In contrast to the \ac{RVC} spatial information about the radiation of the \ac{DUT} can here be measured. There are tow main modes of operation:\begin{enumerate}
\item For \ac{NF} measurements a second reference antenna is introduced to measure the phase. With a transformation in the post production \ac{FF}-behaviour can be derived.
\item In classical \ac{FF} measurements the probe antenna is in the \ac{FF} of the \ac{DUT}.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{\acf{CATR}}: For smaller \acp{ATS} the \ac{CATR} was invented. It uses a parabolic mirror to generate the \ac{FF}-condition in a much smaller volume.
\item \textbf{\acf{OATS}}: Because \acp{AC} are becoming very large and absorbers increase in price at low frequencies \ac{OATS} are used under around $\SI{100}{\mega\hertz}$.
\end{enumerate}

In this document the \ac{AC} is used.

\section{Setting up an OTA-measurement}

The alignment of first the reference antenna and later the \ac{DUT} must be done properly. One opportunity is to take the center of the aperture (used for calibrating with a \ac{SGH}) as center of rotation, the other is to take the phase center, if known.\\
In figure \ref{fig:ats} the second step of an \ac{OTA} measurement is depicted, the calibration. The calibration is carried out by using a known antenna, in figure \ref{fig:ats} a \ac{SGH} with $\SI{20}{\decibeli}$ realized gain is used. With that the influences of the used cables, the probe antenna and the \ac{FSPL} is evaluated. Using a \ac{VNA} this measurement can be done directly. If a signal/spectrum analyzer is to be used the \ac{RF} power at the antenna connector produced by a \ac{VSG} must be measured to get the radiated power using the known calibration antenna. With the following calibration measurement the probe antenna, the cables at receiver side and the \ac{FSPL} is known. \cite{ctiaat}

\section{Link Budget}

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Received power over measurement distance at $\SI{-13}{\decibelm}$ EIRP}
\label{fig:resP}
\end{figure}

The \ac{LB} is the received power $P_{\text{RX}}$ with all losses and gains taken to account:

\begin{equation}
P_{\text{RX}} = P_{\text{TX}}-L_{\text{TX}}+G_{\text{TX}}-L_{\text{FSPL}} + G_{\text{RX}}-L_{\text{RX}}
\end{equation}

The global emission limit is (regarding section \ref{sec:legem}) $\SI{-13}{\decibelm\per\mega\hertz}$. As an example the transmit power is set in figure \ref{fig:resP} to $P_{\text{TX}}=\SI{-13}{\decibelm}$, the cable loss is set to $L_{\text{TX}} = \SI{0}{\decibel}$, the most conservative assumption for the transmit antenna gain is $ G_{\text{TX}} = \SI{0}{\decibeli}$, the \ac{FSPL} is dependant on the distance $d$ so that $L_{\text{FSPL}} = 20\log_{10}\left(4\pi d \cdot\lambda^{-1}\right)\si{\decibel}$, the receive antenna gain (Vivaldi antenna, compare figure \ref{fig:ats}) is about $ G_{\text{RX}} = \SI{14}{\decibeli}$ and the cable loss is $L_{\text{RX}}=\SI{14}{\decibel}$. The resulting received power is depicted in figure \ref{fig:resP}. This is valid for the ATS1000 antenna test system from \ac{RS}. Cable loss increases exponentially with the frequency and the length. Using a bigger chamber would cause longer cables and with that exponentially higher cable loss. This was not considered in figure \ref{fig:resP}, which makes it best case. For the $\SI{56}{\giga\hertz}$ line the squared cable loss was assumed. In summary, for big chambers and high frequencies additional amplifiers are required.\\
The \ac{DANL} of the signal analyzers from \ac{RS} is depicted in annex \ref{fig:danl} with an \ac{RBW} of $f_{\text{RBW}}=\SI{1}{\hertz}$. At $\SI{28}{\giga\hertz}$ and with a \ac{RBW} of $f_{\text{RBW}}=\SI{1}{\mega\hertz}$ the noise level would be approximately $P_N \approx \SI{-100}{\decibelm}$. Regarding figure \ref{fig:resP} for an ATS1000 with $d=\SI{0.5}{\meter}$ the dynamic range is about $\SI{30}{\decibel}$, whereas the dynamic range at $\SI{56}{\giga\hertz}$ would be less then $\SI{10}{\decibel}$, an additional amplifier or a mixer at the probe antenna is required.

\section{Quiet Zone / Measurement Uncertainties in ACs}

\label{fig:qz}
\end{figure}

The main criterion of an \ac{ATS} is the \ac{QZ}. The \ac{QZ} is a volume wherein correct \ac{OTA} measurements can be carried out and the wave fronts are plane. It's size is dependent from the absorbers, the measurement distance and the probe antenna. Normally a amplitude taper of around $\SI{1}{\decibel}$ is accepted.\\
The probe antenna should have a constant sensitivity at the \ac{QZ}. To illustrate that the pattern of the \ac{RS} TC-TA85CP Vivladi antenna is plotted in figure \ref{fig:qz} (a) expressed in sphere radii $r$. This is only valid for small angles with $a=r\cdot\sin \theta$. As an ATS1000 has a measurement distance of $d = \SI{0.5}{\meter}$, the \ac{QZ} would be around $\left(\SI{10}{\centi\meter}\right)^3$.\\
For a arbitrary radiating \ac{DUT} also the difference in \ac{FSPL} is a criterion for the \ac{QZ}-size. For that sake the error in \ac{FSPL} was computed by $\Delta P = 20\log_{10}\left(r\cdot\left(r-\Delta r\right)^{-1}\right)$ and depicted in figure \ref{fig:qz} (b). The \ac{QZ} is again about $\left(\SI{10}{\centi\meter}\right)^3$. The last criterion for the \ac{QZ} is that any reflection in the \ac{ATS} is lower then every relevant feature of the \ac{DUT}s radiation pattern.\cite{ach}\\
The \ac{QZ} size for \acp{CATR} is mainly dependent of the size of the used mirror, it's high frequency quality is correlated with the manufacturing quality of the mirror.

\section{Detector Settings}

\begin{figure}[h]

\def\svgwidth{0.7\textwidth}
\input{Bilder/detectorSetting.pdf_tex}
\caption{Comparison of Detector Settings \cite{funsspec}}
\label{fig:detset}
\end{figure}

With the detector a certain sample in a given interval is chosen, compare figure \ref{fig:detset}. There are six main settings for the detector: \cite{funsspec}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textcolor[RGB]{237,28,36}{Max Peak-detector} takes the maximum value in the given interval.
\item The \textcolor[RGB]{0,166,88}{Min Peak-detector} takes the minimum value in the given interval.
\item The \textcolor[RGB]{0,94,138}{Auto Peak-detector} displays the interval from Min- to Max-Peak.
\item The \textcolor[RGB]{0,173,239}{Sample-detector} takes the first value in the given interval.
\item The \textcolor[RGB]{246,135,18}{RMS-detector} computes the \ac{RMS} of the signal to display.
\item The \textcolor[RGB]{114,100,184}{AV-detector} computes the average of the signal to display.
\end{itemize}

Choosing the correct detector setting is dependent of the expected signal. If a stochastic signal (noise) is to be found, the \ac{RMS}-detector is always the right choice. If it is harmonic, the Max Peak-detector is right. There are two major problems:

\begin{enumerate}
\item By using the Peak-detector for measuring stochastic signals the minimum error is $\SI{2.5}{\decibel}$ when the frequency intervals are short (a lot of display points).
\item If the \ac{RMS}- or AV-detector is used harmonic signals are underrated dependent from the interval length caused by the averaging.
\end{enumerate} 

For a coarse pre scan a Peak-detector is normally used and if something is found a fine scan is carried out with \ac{RMS}-detector at the interesting frequencies.
